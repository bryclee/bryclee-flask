Development of my personal website

## Repo info:
This repo contains the code for my personal website, where I'm highlight the projects I've done and have a location for new projects.

Currently using python and Flask for the back-end, nothing for the front-end, and Heroku for deployment.

## Getting started:
The current process to starting the server locally:

    (should have a virtualenv active)
    pip install -r requirements
    foreman start local
In browser, navigate to localhost:5000

## Next step:
My main priority is to get a portfolio page up, where I can link to different projects and provide descriptions of them.
